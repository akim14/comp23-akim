Cell
An Interactive Fiction by Aromie Kim
Release 1 / Serial number 140314 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

You open your eyes and see nothing but darkness. You try to remember what happened, why you&apos;re here, but thinking alone makes your head throb. Your body shivers as you feel the sudden urge to explore.

Dark Cell
The air feels oddly heavy. The dark is unsettling. A bed is at the corner. A small window sheds some light.

A gated door leads north.

A yellow door leads west.

    <result xml:space="preserve">(first opening the bathroom door)
You open the bathroom and almost reel back from the rancid stench.

Bathroom
A dirty bathroom with a putrid smell. You&apos;d rather not stay here for long.

You can see a bathroom door, a toilet and a medicine cabinet (in which are a card and a key) here.

Dark Cell
The darkness of the room brings some comfort as you open your aching eyes. You struggle to remember what had happened, but your head aches just thinking. The air feels oddly heavy. You can&apos;t see much, but you can see a door to your left, and a gated cell door in front of you.

You can see a bathroom door here.

You can also see a Voice here.

Suddenly, the room echoes with the sound of a tinny voice. &quot;Greetings. You managed to escape your cell. Can you say &quot;Hello&quot; so I know that you can hear me?&quot;

The room is entirely trashed. Papers are scattered all over the floor. You see some photos that resemble X-rays, but they appear to be burnt.

A bedraggled white cat sits snugly on top of a messy desk. A collar is around its neck. It stares at you with beady yellow eyes. The Voice speaks: &quot;That&apos;s Sylvester. He&apos;s quite a friendly cat. He enjoys a nice touch on the head.&quot;

You can also see a gray door, a X-ray and a desk here.

The room is huge and brightly lit. To the left is a heavy, locked door that says &quot;DO NOT ENTER.&quot;

A series of cages line the walls, all open.

There is a small, hand-crafted, wooden maze on a table.

You can also see a heavy door and a cabinet (in which is a key) here.

Experimental Room
An intimidatingly large chair sits in the center of the room. The walls are adorned with pictures of words and drawings of random objects, from houses to animals.

To the left is a heavy, locked door that says &quot;DO NOT ENTER.&quot; You can hear something behind it: is that breathing?

You realize the quiet breathing is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.

    <result xml:space="preserve">It&apos;s an official document: &quot;SUBJECT NAME: 14 (John Akins) Age: 43 Length of Stay: 10 months
 Subject 14 arrived at the facility as a healthy middle-aged male with average memory skills. He performed well in the maze tasks and made few errors in recollection games. After being subjected to the treatment, Subject 14 exhibited gradual memory deterioration, as expected, but at a slower rate than the animals. He made errors in the mazes that he had been trained to do for months. By month 4, his short-term memory worsened to a time capacity of roughly 13 seconds. He struggled in recognizing the faces of his experimenters. By month 7, he failed to recognize a photo of himself, as well as his family members. By month 9, he fiercely demanded to be let out of the facility. We tacitly refused. There is a reason why the experiment went awry, and he is a valuable subject in our attempts to fix the issue. For the moment, we will ask him to continue his participation in the memory tasks.&quot;

Dozens of photos of men and women alike hang on a wire in the air. To the north you can see an entrance to a brightly lit room.

There is a photo within reach.

Sylvester scampers into the room and looks at you meaningfully. &quot;He seems to take a liking to you,&quot; the Voice remarks.

The room is huge and brightly lit.

To the left is a heavy, locked door that says &quot;DO NOT ENTER.&quot; You can hear something behind it: is that breathing?

A series of cages line the walls, all open.

There is a small, hand-crafted, wooden maze on a table.

A black cabinet stands near the table.

A cockroach sits placidly on the cabinet surface.

Sylvester hisses and begins to pace actively around the room

Experimental Room
An intimidatingly large chair sits in the center of the room. The walls are adorned with pictures of words and drawings of random objects, from houses to animals.

To the left is a heavy, locked door that says &quot;DO NOT ENTER.&quot; You can hear something behind it: is that breathing?

You realize the quiet breathing is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.

Chamber
A brightly lit room. A small camera hangs nearly thirteen feet above you. The floor is spotless.

The camera beeps to life.

You can also see a white door here.

Suddenly, the room echoes with the sound of a tinny voice. It sounds artificial. &quot;Hello. You managed to escape your cell. Well done. Can you give me a greeting so I know that you can hear me?&quot;

Equipment Area
The room is entirely trashed. Papers are scattered all over the floor. West is another room, lit in red.

You see some photos that resemble X-rays, but they appear to be burnt.

A deplorable desk is here.

A series of cages line the walls, all open.

There is a small, hand-crafted, wooden maze on a table.

A black cabinet stands near the table.

A cockroach sits placidly on the cabinet surface.

You can also see a heavy door here.

Experimental Room
An intimidatingly large chair sits in the center of the room. The walls are adorned with pictures of words and drawings.

You realize the quiet breathing from before is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.

One drawing is not of an object or person.

You can also see a heavy door here.

    <result xml:space="preserve">It&apos;s an official document: &quot; SOMA MEMORY LABS 
143-21 East Drive, SC, CA 
 Date: June 10, 2013 
SUBJECT NAME: 14 (John Akins) 
Age: 43 
Length of Stay: 10 months
 
Subject 14 arrived at the facility as a healthy middle-aged male with average memory skills. He performed well in the maze tasks and made few errors in recollection games. 
After being subjected to the treatment, Subject 14 exhibited gradual memory deterioration, as expected, but at a slower rate than the animals. He made errors in the mazes that he had been trained to do for months. 
By month 4, his short-term memory worsened to a time capacity of roughly 13 seconds. He struggled in recognizing the faces of his experimenters. 
By month 7, he failed to recognize a photo of himself, as well as his family members. 
By month 9, he fiercely demanded to be let out of the facility. We tacitly refused. There is a reason why the experiment went awry, and he is a valuable subject in our attempts to fix the issue. We&apos;ve been working for years on this project; it&apos;s preposterous that the outcome completely counters our goals. For the moment, we will ask him to continue his participation in the memory tasks. Perhaps we may have to expand the types of tasks our subjects perform to get to the heart of the issue.&quot;

Giant white walls. It&apos;s almost like a human-sized maze...except there are giant holes made in the white walls. Some blood disturbs the white.

Graffiti lines the walls. It looks as if different people had written haphazardly on them.

&quot;It&apos;s funny,&quot; the Voice muses. &quot;They had to do this damn maze all the time and always complained that they wanted to just get out...it took them a while to figure out that they could just break down the walls. They always had the chance to escape.&quot;

 Subject 11519 has been exhibiting the same kind of behavior ever since his treatment. He has been traversing the entire facility, each and every room. Whenever he reaches the Experimental room, he marks the map with a tally mark and his initials. 
 The subject had entered the facility as a young man who suffered from severe depression. He came after we advertised under the new motto that the military had told us to take on: &quot;New memory therapy for your mental health.&quot; His consent form reveals that his motive for joining our project was to &quot;Be happier.&quot; Memory loss can assist this, but we did not reveal to him the grave turnabout of our experiments, the fact that our research was meant to completely annihilate the capability to remember at all. 
 But Subject 11519 persists in his travels. He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be. 
 Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?&quot;

&quot;You&apos;ve been doing well,&quot; the Voice suddenly spoke. It sounds quieter than usual. &quot;Can you do me a favor? There is a room up ahead at the end of the maze. Can you go there?&quot;

    <result xml:space="preserve">Maze Room
Giant white walls. It&apos;s almost like a human-sized maze...except there are giant holes made in the white walls. Some blood disturbs the white.

Graffiti lines the walls. It looks as if different people had written haphazardly on them.

&quot;It&apos;s funny,&quot; the Voice muses. &quot;They had to do this damn maze all the time and always complained that they wanted to just get out...it took them a while to figure out that they could just break down the walls. They always had the chance to escape.&quot; 
 Sylvester walks through the maze with ease and steps over a folder on the ground.

    <result xml:space="preserve">It contains a bunch of important looking papers. One in particular stands out: &quot;
 Subject 11519 has been exhibiting the same kind of behavior ever since his treatment. He has been traversing the entire facility, each and every room. Whenever he reaches the Experimental room, he marks the map with a tally mark and his initials. 
 The subject had entered the facility as a young man who suffered from severe depression. He came after we advertised under the new motto that the military had told us to take on: &quot;New memory therapy for your mental health.&quot; His consent form reveals that his motive for joining our project was to &quot;Be happier.&quot; Memory loss can assist this, but we did not reveal to him the grave turnabout of our experiments, the fact that our research was meant to completely annihilate the capability to remember at all. 
 But Subject 11519 persists in his travels. He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be. 
 Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?&quot;

&quot;You&apos;ve been doing well,&quot; the Voice suddenly spoke. It sounds quieter than usual. &quot;Can you do me a favor? There is a room up ahead at the end of the maze. Once you&apos;re done exploring this area, can you go there?&quot;

One drawing is not of an object or person.

You realize the quiet breathing from before is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.

    <result xml:space="preserve">It&apos;s an official document: &quot; SOMA MEMORY LABS 
143-21 East Drive, SC, CA 
 Date: June 10, 2013 
SUBJECT NAME: 14 (John Akins) 
Age: 43 
Length of Stay: 10 months
 
Subject 14 arrived at the facility as a healthy middle-aged male with average memory skills. He performed well in the maze tasks and made few errors in recollection games. 
After being subjected to the treatment, Subject 14 exhibited gradual memory deterioration, as expected, but at a slower rate than the animals. He made errors in the mazes that he had been trained to do for months. 
By month 4, his short-term memory worsened to a time capacity of roughly 13 seconds. He struggled in recognizing the faces of his experimenters. 
By month 7, he failed to recognize a photo of himself, as well as his family members. 
By month 9, he fiercely demanded to be let out of the facility. We tacitly refused. There is a reason why the experiment went awry, and he is a valuable subject in our attempts to fix the issue. We&apos;ve been working for years on this project; it&apos;s preposterous that the outcome completely counters our goals. For the moment, we will ask him to continue his participation in the memory tasks. Perhaps we may have to expand the types of tasks our subjects perform to get to the heart of the issue. I heard of a suggestion for a human-sized maze. Interesting proposition.&quot;

 Subject 11519 has been exhibiting the same kind of behavior ever since his treatment. He has been traversing the entire facility, each and every room. Whenever he reaches the Experimental room, he marks the map with a tally mark and his initials. 
 The subject had entered the facility as a young man who suffered from severe depression. He came after we advertised under the new motto that the military had told us to take on: &quot;New memory therapy for your mental health.&quot; His consent form reveals that his motive for joining our project was to &quot;Be happier.&quot; Memory loss can assist this, but we did not reveal to him the grave turnabout of our experiments, the fact that our research was meant to completely annihilate the capability to remember at all. 
 But Subject 11519 persists in his travels. He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be. 
 Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?&quot;

&quot;You&apos;ve been doing well,&quot; the Voice suddenly spoke. It sounds quieter than usual. &quot;There is a room up ahead at the end of the maze. Once you&apos;re done exploring this area, can you walk through the holes and get to the end of the maze?&quot;

Suddenly, the room echoes with the sound of a tinny voice. It sounds somewhat muffled, hidden behind an artificial tone. &quot;Hello. You finally woke up, I see. Hope you had adequate sleep. Can you give me a greeting so I know that you can hear me?&quot;

You see some photos that resemble X-rays, but they appear to be burnt.

A deplorable desk is here.

A bedraggled white cat sits snugly on top of a messy desk. A collar is around its neck. It stares at you with beady yellow eyes. 
&quot;That&apos;s Sylvester.&quot; You jump, startled, as you hear the artificial Voice echo in the room you&apos;re in. &quot;He&apos;s quite a friendly cat. He enjoys a nice touch on the head.&quot;

 Date: June 10, 2013 
SUBJECT NAME: 14 (John Akins) 
Age: 43 
Length of Stay: 10 months
 
Subject 14 arrived at the facility as a healthy middle-aged male with average memory skills. He performed well in the maze tasks and made few errors in recollection games. 
After being subjected to the treatment, Subject 14 exhibited gradual memory deterioration, as expected, but at a slower rate than the animals. He made errors in the mazes that he had been trained to do for months. 
By month 4, his short-term memory worsened to a time capacity of roughly 13 seconds. He struggled in recognizing the faces of his experimenters. 
By month 7, he failed to recognize a photo of himself, as well as his family members. 
By month 9, he fiercely demanded to be let out of the facility. We tacitly refused. There is a reason why the experiment went awry, and he is a valuable subject in our attempts to fix the issue. We&apos;ve been working for years on this project; it&apos;s preposterous that the outcome completely counters our goals. For the moment, we will ask him to continue his participation in the memory tasks. Perhaps we may have to expand the types of tasks our subjects perform to get to the heart of the issue. I heard of a suggestion for a human-sized maze. Interesting proposition.&quot;

He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be.
 
 Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?

&quot;You&apos;ve been doing well,&quot; the Voice suddenly spoke. It sounds quieter than usual. &quot;There is a room up ahead at the end of the maze. Once you&apos;re done exploring this area, can you walk through the holes and get to the end of the maze?&quot;

A black cabinet stands near the table.

A cockroach sits placidly on the cabinet surface.

We knew it wouldn&apos;t take long for them to sniff out what we were doing. But we didn&apos;t think they would come so soon. The military wasted no time approaching the supervisor and compelling him (yes, I say compel) to make our facility&apos;s research an undercover study. 
We originally strove to find a way to enhance human memory. We failed and found a way to disintegrate it. Our trash became someone else&apos;s treasure. 
Those government dogs told us why we should continue. The memory-disintegration method, they claim, will be extraordinarily helpful for their work. POWs will forget all they have seen during their stay with the enemy when they are returned. Those who have seen too much of what lies behind the government veil will no longer be a threat. 
A good number of us have protested vigorously, but not for long, unsurprisingly. Some are thrilled by the change in objective, taking delight in the so-called &quot;partnership&quot; with the military. As for me, I have only the deepest of doubts about this operation. We are doing a service to our country, they said. I feel no pride in doing it. 
In the next month, we are changing the experimentation designs. To find test subjects, we are projecting ourselves to the public under a new slogan that we offer therapeutic treatment for those with mental conditions.&quot; 
 
 Entry # 2 
Date: February 6, 2016 
I am supervising the progress of one of the newest participants to arrive to our facility. His name is Sebastian Weaver, under subject number 11519. A typical severely-depressed young male who yearned to be happy. &quot;Do good, Parr,&quot; Kevin had said, patting me on the back. I nearly punched his face. 
When I spoke to him during his interview, I wished I had just told him the truth. Just blurt out what we were really doing. But, coward that I am, I didn&apos;t. I sometimes wonder why I stay in this damn place, but it is then that I see the faces of Isabel and Joanne. Surely, since I know the truth behind our research, I know a valuable secret of the military. Surely, if I attempt to escape, they will...&quot;deal&quot; with me. And perhaps Isabel and Joanne as well, once they start questioning my disappearance. 
What irony...to believe that the very place I had considered my intellectual monastery is now the darkest of cells. All of us, test subjects and experimenters alike, are like the test rats in the cages of our facility. We are trapped.&quot; 
 
The rest of the pages are torn.

&quot;Those were memories. Don&apos;t let the apparent absence of memories convince you that they are completely gone. You must explore.&quot; The Voice halters. &quot;Someone taught me that. It only took me a while to realize.&quot; 
Sylvester sits musingly near the drawer compartment on the ground.

 Entry #5 
 Date: October 6, 2016 
 Subject 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
 I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked, just as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily activity. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

You see a tape recorder under the papers.

&quot;So they&apos;ve finally rebelled. At long last. Luckily for me, I expected it. I heard the subjects murmur under their breaths, fall silent when an experimenter walks by. But I heard them. They knew. They figured it out 
They&apos;ve done a fine job. Made every one of my colleagues run faster than I&apos;ve ever seen them run. I hid in this room until the storm passed. When I ventured outside, the facility was empty. The test subjects escaped...well, most of them. There is still Subject 46, Edward Baker, and, of course...he must still be around.&quot; 
There is a hefty sigh. 
 &quot;It&apos;s been two days since the breakout. The military hasn&apos;t arrived. If they do, they&apos;ll just find me, and two failures of test subjects. Hah. Well, my dear, dear government, how do you like that?&quot; 
You hear the sound of a bottle swishing. The man recording must be drinking something. 
&quot;Regardless...I&apos;m glad. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should do now. I considered burning this place down. Maybe I should. Make it seem like this place never existed...wipe it out of people&apos;s memories...heh! After that, I&apos;ll go home...yes, I&apos;ll go home. And make myself disappear. They can&apos;t find me. Nor my family. 
And yet...I linger here. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown attached to my haven-turned-prison. A bittersweet attachment. No matter. I&apos;ve stayed here for long enough. I must depart before those uniform-donning dogs arrive. 
Ah...but of course... Yes. My sliver of hope throughout all these months. The resistor. I feel the urge to watch him again...to observe his steady march through the facility...He forgets every time he does it, but he does it every day...like an automaton. 
I think...I will stay. Watch him, for one last time, before I leave this place. But this time, he won&apos;t return to his cell. He&apos;ll be gone, like the others. I&apos;ll make sure of it. 
My name is Doctor John Parr, supervising researcher at Soma Memory Labs. Date...I&apos;ve lost track. Who cares. This will be my last experimental observation.&quot; 
 
 The recorder falls silent.

The room is huge and brightly lit. It smells like a zoo. If you stay quiet, you can hear muffled breathing coming from somewhere...

A heavy door leadseast.

A series of cages line the walls, all open.

There is a small, hand-crafted, wooden maze on a table.

A black cabinet stands near the table.

A cockroach sits placidly on the cabinet surface.

Sylvester saunters into the room after you, purring and wearing a rather satisfied look on his face. You can only guess why.

Equipment Area
The room is entirely trashed. Papers are scattered all over the gray floor. Westward you can see another room, lit in an ominous red color.

You see some photos that resemble X-rays, but they appear to be burnt.

A deplorable desk is here.

A bedraggled white cat sits snugly on top of a messy desk. A collar is around its neck. It stares at you with beady yellow eyes. 
&quot;That&apos;s Sylvester.&quot; You jump, startled, as you hear the artificial Voice echo in the room you&apos;re in. &quot;He&apos;s quite a friendly cat. He enjoys a nice touch on the head.&quot;

Red Room
Dozens of photos of men and women alike, from young to old, hang on a wire in the air. This is a photo-developing room, it seems. To the north you can see an entrance to a brightly lit room.

There is a photo within reach, dangling precariously from a clip on the wire.

Out of the corner of your eye, you see a white mouse nibbling at something near the wall.

 Subject 11519 has been exhibiting the same kind of behavior ever since his treatment. He has been traversing the entire facility, each and every room. Whenever he reaches the Experimental room, he marks the map with a tally mark and his initials.
 
 The subject had entered the facility as a young man who suffered from severe depression. He came after we advertised under the new motto that the military had told us to take on: &quot;New memory therapy for your mental health.&quot; His consent form reveals that his motive for joining our project was to &quot;Be happier.&quot; Memory loss can assist this, but we did not reveal to him the grave turnabout of our experiments, the fact that our research was meant to completely annihilate the capability to remember at all.
 
 But Subject 11519 persists in his travels. He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be.
 
 Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?

&quot;You&apos;ve been doing well,&quot; the Voice suddenly spoke. It sounds quieter than usual. &quot;There is a room up ahead at the end of the maze. Once you&apos;re done exploring this area, can you squeeze through the holes and get to the end of the maze?&quot;

Experimental Room
An intimidatingly large chair sits in the center of the room. The walls are adorned with pictures of words and drawings. Up ahead is an entryway...its door almost completely shattered.

Nearby a heavy door leads west to the Lab.

One drawing is not of an object or person.

You realize the quiet breathing from before is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.

 Subject 11519 has been exhibiting the same kind of behavior ever since his treatment. He has been traversing the entire facility, each and every room. Whenever he reaches the Experimental room, he marks the map with a tally mark and his initials.
 
 The subject had entered the facility as a young man who suffered from severe depression. He came after we advertised under the new motto that the military had told us to take on: &quot;New memory therapy for your mental health.&quot; His consent form reveals that his motive for joining our project was to &quot;Be happier.&quot; Memory loss can assist this, but we did not reveal to him the grave turnabout of our experiments, the fact that our research was meant to completely annihilate the capability to remember at all.
 
 But Subject 11519 persists in his travels. He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be.
 
 Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?

&quot;You&apos;ve been doing well,&quot; the Voice suddenly spoke. It sounds quieter than usual. &quot;There is a room up ahead at the end of the maze. Once you&apos;re done exploring this area, can you squeeze through the holes and get to the end of the maze?&quot;

We knew it wouldn&apos;t take long for them to sniff out what we were doing. But we didn&apos;t think they would come so soon. The military wasted no time approaching the supervisor and compelling him (yes, I say compel) to make our facility&apos;s research an undercover study. 
 We originally strove to find a way to enhance human memory. We failed and found a way to disintegrate it. Our trash became someone else&apos;s treasure. 
 Those government dogs told us why we should continue.  disintegration method, they claim, will be extraordinarily helpful for their work. POWs will forget all they have seen during their stay with the enemy when they are returned. Those who have seen too much of what lies behind the government veil will no longer be a threat. 
 A good number of us have protested vigorously, but not for long, unsurprisingly. Some are thrilled by the change in objective, taking delight in the so-called &quot;partnership&quot; with the military. As for me, I have only the deepest of doubts about this operation. We are doing a service to our country, they said. I feel no pride for doing it. 
 In the next month, we are changing the experimentation designs. To find test subjects, we are projecting ourselves to the public under a new slogan that we offer therapeutic treatment for those with mental conditions.&quot;

 I am supervising the progress of one of the newest participants to arrive to our facility. His name is Sebastian Weaver, under subject number 11519. A typical severely-depressed young male who yearned to be happy. &quot;Do good, Parr,&quot; Kevin had said, patting me on the back. I almost wanted to punch his face. 
 When I spoke to him during his interview, I wished I had just told him the truth. Just blurt out what we were really doing. But, coward that I am, I didn&apos;t. I sometimes wonder why I stayed in this damn place, but it is then that I see the face of Isabel and Joanne. Surely, since I know the truth behind our research, I know a valuable secret of the military. Surely, if I attempt to escape, they will...&quot;deal&quot; with me. And perhaps Isabel and Joanne as well, once they start questioning my disappearance. 
 What irony...to believe that the very place I had considered my intellectual monastery is now my the darkest of cells. All of us, test subjects and experimenters alike, are like the rats in the cages of our facility.&quot;

The room is entirely trashed. Papers are scattered all over the gray floor. Westward you can see another room, lit in an ominous red color.

You see some photos that resemble X-rays, but they appear to be burnt.

A deplorable desk is here.

A bedraggled white cat sits snugly on top of a messy desk. A collar is around its neck. It stares at you with beady yellow eyes. 
&quot;That&apos;s Sylvester.&quot; You jump, startled, as you hear the artificial Voice echo in the room you&apos;re in. &quot;He&apos;s quite a friendly cat. He enjoys a nice touch on the head.&quot;

We knew it wouldn&apos;t take long for them to sniff out what we were doing. But we didn&apos;t think they would come so soon. The military wasted no time approaching the supervisor and compelling him (yes, I say compel) to make our facility&apos;s research an undercover study. 
 We originally strove to find a way to enhance human memory. We failed and found a way to disintegrate it. Our trash became someone else&apos;s treasure. 
 Those government dogs told us why we should continue.  disintegration method, they claim, will be extraordinarily helpful for their work. POWs will forget all they have seen during their stay with the enemy when they are returned. Those who have seen too much of what lies behind the government veil will no longer be a threat. 
 A good number of us have protested vigorously, but not for long, unsurprisingly. Some are thrilled by the change in objective, taking delight in the so-called &quot;partnership&quot; with the military. As for me, I have only the deepest of doubts about this operation. We are doing a service to our country, they said. I feel no pride for doing it. 
 In the next month, we are changing the experimentation designs. To find test subjects, we are projecting ourselves to the public under a new slogan that we offer therapeutic treatment for those with mental conditions.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Entry # 2 
Date: February 6, 2016 
 I am supervising the progress of one of the newest participants to arrive to our facility. His name is Sebastian Weaver, under subject number 11519. A typical severely-depressed young male who yearned to be happy. &quot;Do good, Parr,&quot; Kevin had said, patting me on the back. I almost wanted to punch his face. 
 When I spoke to him during his interview, I wished I had just told him the truth. Just blurt out what we were really doing. But, coward that I am, I didn&apos;t. I sometimes wonder why I stayed in this damn place, but it is then that I see the face of Isabel and Joanne. Surely, since I know the truth behind our research, I know a valuable secret of the military. Surely, if I attempt to escape, they will...&quot;deal&quot; with me. And perhaps Isabel and Joanne as well, once they start questioning my disappearance. 
 What irony...to believe that the very place I had considered my intellectual monastery is now my the darkest of cells. All of us, test subjects and experimenters alike, are like the rats in the cages of our facility.&quot; 
 
The rest of the pages are torn.

&quot;Those were memories. Don&apos;t let the apparent absence of memories convince you that they are completely gone. You must explore.&quot; The Voice halters. &quot;Someone taught me that. It only took me a while to realize.&quot; 
 Sylvester sits musingly near the drawer compartment on the ground.

 Entry #5 
 Date: October 6, 2016 
 Subject 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
 I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked, just as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily activity. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

You see a tape recorder under the papers.

    <result xml:space="preserve">A voice speaks. It is masculine and sounds bone-weary. The voice sounds somewhat familiar. 
 &quot;So they&apos;ve finally rebelled. At long last. Luckily for me, I expected it. I heard the subjects murmur under their breaths, fall silent when an experimenter walks by. But I heard them. They knew. They figured it out 
 They&apos;ve done a fine job. Made every one of my colleagues run faster than I&apos;ve ever seen them run. I hid in this room until the storm passed. When I ventured outside, the facility was empty. The test subjects escaped...well, most of them. There is still Subject 46, Edward Baker, and, of course...he must still be around.&quot; 
 There is a hefty sigh. 
 &quot;It&apos;s been two days since the breakout. The military hasn&apos;t arrived. If they do, they&apos;ll just find me, and two failures of test subjects. Hah. Well, my dear, dear government, how do you like that?&quot; 
 You hear the sound of a bottle swishing. The man recording must be drinking something. 
 &quot;Regardless...I&apos;m glad. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should do now. I considered burning this place down. Maybe I should. Make it seem like this place never existed...wipe it out of people&apos;s memories...heh! After that, I&apos;ll go home...yes, I&apos;ll go home. And make myself disappear. They can&apos;t find me. Nor my family. 
 And yet...I linger here. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown attached to my haven-turned-prison. A bittersweet attachment. No matter. I&apos;ve stayed here for long enough. I must depart before those uniform-donning dogs arrive. 
 Ah...but of course... Yes. My sliver of hope throughout all these months. The resistor. I feel the urge to watch him again...to observe his steady march through the facility...He forgets every time he does it, but he does it every day...like an automaton. 
I think...I will stay. Watch him, for one last time, before I leave this place. But this time, he won&apos;t return to his cell. He&apos;ll be gone, like the others. I&apos;ll make sure of it. 
 My name is Doctor John Parr, supervising researcher at Soma Memory Labs. Date...I&apos;ve lost track. Who cares. This will be my last experimental observation.&quot; 
 
 The recorder falls silent. 
 &quot;...Yes. That&apos;s it.&quot; The Voice sounds faintly approving. &quot;Well done. Do you see that keypad to your right? Why don&apos;t you type in the key. You&apos;re almost done.&quot;

Giant white walls. It&apos;s almost like a human-sized maze. Some blood disturbs the white.

Large holes are on the walls.

Graffiti lines the walls. It looks as if different people had written haphazardly on them.

&quot;It&apos;s funny,&quot; the Voice muses. &quot;They had to do this damn maze all the time and always complained that they wanted to just get out...it took them a while to figure out that they could just break down the walls. They always had the chance to escape.&quot;

 Subject 11519 has been exhibiting the same kind of behavior ever since his treatment. He has been traversing the entire facility, each and every room. Whenever he reaches the Experimental room, he marks the map with a tally mark and his initials.
 
 The subject had entered the facility as a young man who suffered from severe depression. He came after we advertised under the new motto that the military had told us to take on: &quot;New memory therapy for your mental health.&quot; His consent form reveals that his motive for joining our project was to &quot;Be happier.&quot; Memory loss can assist this, but we did not reveal to him the grave turnabout of our experiments, the fact that our research was meant to completely annihilate the capability to remember at all.
 
 But Subject 11519 persists in his travels. He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be.
 
 Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?

&quot;You&apos;ve been doing well,&quot; the Voice suddenly spoke. It sounds quieter than usual. &quot;There is a room up ahead at the end of the maze. Once you&apos;re done exploring this area, can you squeeze through the holes and get to the end of the maze?&quot;

We knew it wouldn&apos;t take long for them to sniff out what we were doing. But we didn&apos;t think they would come so soon. The military wasted no time approaching the supervisor and compelling him (yes, I say compel) to make our facility&apos;s research an undercover study. 
 We originally strove to find a way to enhance human memory. We failed and found a way to disintegrate it. Our trash became someone else&apos;s treasure. 
 Those government dogs told us why we should continue.  disintegration method, they claim, will be extraordinarily helpful for their work. POWs will forget all they have seen during their stay with the enemy when they are returned. Those who have seen too much of what lies behind the government veil will no longer be a threat. 
 A good number of us have protested vigorously, but not for long, unsurprisingly. Some are thrilled by the change in objective, taking delight in the so-called &quot;partnership&quot; with the military. As for me, I have only the deepest of doubts about this operation. We are doing a service to our country, they said. I feel no pride for doing it. 
 In the next month, we are changing the experimentation designs. To find test subjects, we are projecting ourselves to the public under a new slogan that we offer therapeutic treatment for those with mental conditions.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Entry # 2 
Date: February 6, 2016 
 I am supervising the progress of one of the newest participants to arrive to our facility. His name is Sebastian Weaver, under subject number 11519. A typical severely-depressed young male who yearned to be happy. &quot;Do good, Parr,&quot; Kevin had said, patting me on the back. I almost wanted to punch his face. 
 When I spoke to him during his interview, I wished I had just told him the truth. Just blurt out what we were really doing. But, coward that I am, I didn&apos;t. I sometimes wonder why I stayed in this damn place, but it is then that I see the face of Isabel and Joanne. Surely, since I know the truth behind our research, I know a valuable secret of the military. Surely, if I attempt to escape, they will...&quot;deal&quot; with me. And perhaps Isabel and Joanne as well, once they start questioning my disappearance. 
 What irony...to believe that the very place I had considered my intellectual monastery is now my the darkest of cells. All of us, test subjects and experimenters alike, are like the rats in the cages of our facility.&quot; 
 
The rest of the pages are torn.

&quot;Those were memories. Don&apos;t let the apparent absence of memories convince you that they are completely gone. You must explore.&quot; The Voice halters. &quot;Someone taught me that. It only took me a while to realize.&quot; 
 Sylvester sits musingly near the drawer compartment on the ground.

 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
 I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily life. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

&quot;So they&apos;ve finally rebelled. At long last. Luckily for me, I expected it. I heard the subjects murmur under their breaths, fall silent when an experimenter walks by. But I heard them. They knew. They figured it out 
They&apos;ve done a fine job. Made every one of my colleagues run faster than I&apos;ve ever seen them run. I hid in this room until the storm passed. When I ventured outside, the facility was empty. The test subjects escaped...well, most of them. There is still Subject 46, Edward Baker, and, of course...he must still be around.&quot; 
There is a hefty sigh. 
 &quot;It&apos;s been two days since the breakout. The military hasn&apos;t arrived. If they do, they&apos;ll just find me, and two failures of test subjects. Hah. Well, my dear, dear government, how do you like that?&quot; 
You hear the sound of a bottle swishing. The man recording must be drinking something. 
&quot;Regardless...I&apos;m glad. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should do now. I considered burning this place down. Maybe I should. Make it seem like this place never existed...wipe it out of people&apos;s memories...heh! After that, I&apos;ll go home...yes, I&apos;ll go home. And make myself disappear. They can&apos;t find me. Nor my family. 
And yet...I linger here. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown attached to my haven-turned-prison. A bittersweet attachment. No matter. I&apos;ve stayed here for long enough. I must depart before those uniform-donning dogs arrive. 
Ah...but of course... Yes. My sliver of hope throughout all these months. The resistor. I feel the urge to watch him again...to observe his steady march through the facility...He forgets every time he does it, but he does it every day...like an automaton. 
I think...I will stay. Watch him, for one last time, before I leave this place. But this time, he won&apos;t return to his cell. He&apos;ll be gone, like the others. I&apos;ll make sure of it. 
My name is Doctor John Parr, supervising researcher at Soma Memory Labs. Date...I&apos;ve lost track. Who cares. This will be my last experimental observation.&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s funny,&quot; the Voice muses. &quot;They had to do this damn maze all the time and always complained that they wanted to just get out...it took them a while to figure out that they could just break down the walls. They always had the chance to escape.&quot;

 Entry #5 
 Date: October 6, 2016 
 Subject 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
 I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked, just as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily activity. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

You see a tape recorder under the papers.

&quot;So they&apos;ve finally rebelled. At long last. Luckily for me, I expected it. I heard the subjects murmur under their breaths, fall silent when an experimenter walks by. But I heard them. They knew. They figured it out 
They&apos;ve done a fine job. Made every one of my colleagues run faster than I&apos;ve ever seen them run. I hid in this room until the storm passed. When I ventured outside, the facility was empty. The test subjects escaped...well, most of them. There is still Subject 46, Edward Baker, and, of course...he must still be around.&quot; 
There is a hefty sigh. 
 &quot;It&apos;s been two days since the breakout. The military hasn&apos;t arrived. If they do, they&apos;ll just find me, and two failures of test subjects. Hah. Well, my dear, dear government, how do you like that?&quot; 
You hear the sound of a bottle swishing. The man recording must be drinking something. 
&quot;Regardless...I&apos;m glad. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should do now. I considered burning this place down. Maybe I should. Make it seem like this place never existed...wipe it out of people&apos;s memories...heh! After that, I&apos;ll go home...yes, I&apos;ll go home. And make myself disappear. They can&apos;t find me. Nor my family. 
And yet...I linger here. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown attached to my haven-turned-prison. A bittersweet attachment. No matter. I&apos;ve stayed here for long enough. I must depart before those uniform-donning dogs arrive. 
Ah...but of course... Yes. My sliver of hope throughout all these months. The resistor. I feel the urge to watch him again...to observe his steady march through the facility...He forgets every time he does it, but he does it every day...like an automaton. 
I think...I will stay. Watch him, for one last time, before I leave this place. But this time, he won&apos;t return to his cell. He&apos;ll be gone, like the others. I&apos;ll make sure of it. 
My name is Doctor John Parr, supervising researcher at Soma Memory Labs. Date...I&apos;ve lost track. Who cares. This will be my last experimental observation.&quot; 
 
 The recorder falls silent. 
 &quot;...Yes. That&apos;s it.&quot; The Voice sounds faintly approving. &quot;Well done. Do you see that keypad to your right? Why don&apos;t you type in the key. You&apos;re almost done.&quot;

Exit
A dark room. The right wall is covered with numerous televisions, each depicting a room you have explored.

A door is up ahead. Above it is a sign with neon-red letters: EXIT. A middle-aged man stands near a door. He is wearing a white gown that has been dirtied. His face is haggard and his eyes droop by the weight of their bags. One lens of his glasses is cracked. 
He nods once and speaks. &quot;You&apos;ve made it. This is the 93rd time you&apos;ve walked the halls of this facility, but you never ended up here. Yes, you&apos;ve been experiencing amnesiac episodes, but those will pass soon enough. I&apos;ve stopped treating you months ago, so you won&apos;t end up like...like Subject 14.&quot; 
His voice, although weary, sounds like the Voice. His breath reeks of alcohol. 
&quot;Many dreams were built here. Many...memories.&quot; He grounds out the word. &quot;It won&apos;t be long before they find us. Find me. I&apos;ve stayed here for too long. And I must go.&quot; 
He cracks a small smile at you. An artificial smile. &quot;My name is Doctor John Parr,&quot; he says in the voice of a doctor greeting a patient. The words sound familiar. As if you had heard it months ago. &quot;Your experiment has been concluded. Thank you for your participation. We value your support and patience.&quot; 
The doctor opens the door, revealing a flat, sandy field. Outside. &quot;Forget I existed,&quot; he says quietly. &quot;Forget this face. Live your life and make lasting memories. I hope you become happy, Sebastian Weaver. Goodbye.&quot;

Experimental Room
An intimidatingly large chair sits in the center of the room. The walls are adorned with pictures of words and drawings. 
Up ahead is an entryway...its door hangs off its hinges, almost completely shattered.

Nearby a heavy door leads west to the Lab.

One drawing is not of an object or person.

You realize the quiet breathing from before is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.

 Subject 11519 has been exhibiting the same kind of behavior ever since his treatment. He has been traversing the entire facility, each and every room. Whenever he reaches the Experimental room, he marks the map with a tally mark and his initials.
 
 The subject had entered the facility as a young man who suffered from severe depression. He came after we advertised under the new motto that the military had told us to take on: &quot;New memory therapy for your mental health.&quot; His consent form reveals that his motive for joining our project was to &quot;Be happier.&quot; Memory loss can assist this, but we did not reveal to him the grave turnabout of our experiments, the fact that our research was meant to completely annihilate the capability to remember at all.
 
 But Subject 11519 persists in his travels. He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be.
 
 Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?

&quot;You&apos;ve been doing well,&quot; the Voice suddenly spoke. It sounds quieter than usual. &quot;There is a room up ahead at the end of the maze. Once you&apos;re done exploring this area, can you squeeze through the holes and get to the end of the maze?&quot;

Ah...but of course... Yes. My sliver of hope throughout all these months. The resistor. I feel the urge to watch him again...to observe his steady march through the facility...He forgets every time he does it, but he does it every day...like an automaton. 
I think...I will stay. Watch him, for one last time, before I leave this place. But this time, he won&apos;t return to his cell. He&apos;ll be gone, like the others. I&apos;ll make sure of it. 
My name is Doctor John Parr, supervising researcher at Soma Memory Labs. Date...I&apos;ve lost track. Who cares. This will be my last experimental observation.&quot; 
 
 The recorder falls silent. 
 &quot;...Yes. That&apos;s it.&quot; The Voice sounds faintly approving. &quot;Well done. Do you see that keypad to your right? Why don&apos;t you type in the key. You&apos;re almost done.&quot;

Exit
A dark room. The right wall is covered with numerous televisions, each depicting a room you have explored.

A door is up ahead. Above it is a sign with neon-red letters: EXIT. A middle-aged man stands near a door. He is wearing a white gown that has been dirtied. His face is haggard and his eyes droop by the weight of their bags. One lens of his glasses is cracked. 
He nods once and speaks. &quot;You&apos;ve made it. This is the 93rd time you&apos;ve walked the halls of this facility, but you never ended up here. Yes, you&apos;ve been experiencing amnesiac episodes, but those will pass soon enough. I&apos;ve stopped treating you months ago, so you won&apos;t end up like...like Subject 14.&quot; 
 His voice, although weary, sounds like the Voice. His breath reeks of alcohol. 
 &quot;Many dreams were built here. Many...memories.&quot; He grounds out the word. &quot;It won&apos;t be long before they find us. Find me. I&apos;ve stayed here for too long. And I must go.&quot; 
 He cracks a small smile at you. An artificial smile. &quot;My name is Doctor John Parr,&quot; he says in a voice of a doctor greeting a patient. It sounds familiar. &quot;Your experiment has been concluded. Thank you for your participation. We value your support and patience. But tell me...can you forgive us? Yes or no?&quot;

 Entry #5 
 Date: October 6, 2016 
 Subject 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
 I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked, just as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily activity. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

You see a tape recorder under the papers.

&quot;So they&apos;ve finally rebelled. At long last. Luckily for me, I expected it. I heard the subjects murmur under their breaths, fall silent when an experimenter walks by. But I heard them. They knew. They figured it out 
They&apos;ve done a fine job. Made every one of my colleagues run faster than I&apos;ve ever seen them run. I hid in this room until the storm passed. When I ventured outside, the facility was empty. The test subjects escaped...well, most of them. There is still Subject 46, Edward Baker, and, of course...he must still be around.&quot; 
There is a hefty sigh. 
 &quot;It&apos;s been two days since the breakout. The military hasn&apos;t arrived. If they do, they&apos;ll just find me, and two failures of test subjects. Hah. Well, my dear, dear government, how do you like that?&quot; 
You hear the sound of a bottle swishing. The man recording must be drinking something. 
&quot;Regardless...I&apos;m glad. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should do now. I considered burning this place down. Maybe I should. Make it seem like this place never existed...wipe it out of people&apos;s memories...heh! After that, I&apos;ll go home...yes, I&apos;ll go home. And make myself disappear. They can&apos;t find me. Nor my family. 
And yet...I linger here. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown attached to my haven-turned-prison. A bittersweet attachment. No matter. I&apos;ve stayed here for long enough. I must depart before those uniform-donning dogs arrive.

Research Room
A large room half-lit with flickering fluorescent lights. There are photos of men and women on the walls. A map of the human brain is also hung up.

A drawer compartment sits on the floor.

A diary sits on top of a cracked table. &quot;Give it a read.&quot; The Voice sounded pained.

We knew it wouldn&apos;t take long for them to sniff out what we were doing. But we didn&apos;t think they would come so soon. The military wasted no time approaching the supervisor and compelling him (yes, I say compel) to make our facility&apos;s research an undercover study. 
We originally strove to find a way to enhance human memory. We failed and found a way to disintegrate it. Our trash became someone else&apos;s treasure. 
Those government dogs told us why we should continue. The memory-disintegration method, they claim, will be extraordinarily helpful for their work. POWs will forget all they have seen during their stay with the enemy when they are returned. Those who have seen too much of what lies behind the government veil will no longer be a threat. 
A good number of us have protested vigorously, but not for long, unsurprisingly. Some are thrilled by the change in objective, taking delight in the so-called &quot;partnership&quot; with the military. As for me, I have only the deepest of doubts about this operation. We are doing a service to our country, they said. I feel no pride in doing it. 
In the next month, we are changing the experimentation designs. To find test subjects, we are projecting ourselves to the public under a new slogan that we offer therapeutic treatment for those with mental conditions.&quot; 
 
 Entry # 2 
Date: February 6, 2016 
I am supervising the progress of one of the newest participants to arrive to our facility. His name is Sebastian Weaver, under subject number 11519. A typical severely-depressed young male who yearned to be happy. &quot;Do good, Parr,&quot; Kevin had said, patting me on the back. I nearly punched his face. 
When I spoke to him during his interview, I wished I had just told him the truth. Just blurt out what we were really doing. But, coward that I am, I didn&apos;t. I sometimes wonder why I stay in this damn place, but it is then that I see the faces of Isabel and Joanne. Surely, since I know the truth behind our research, I know a valuable secret of the military. Surely, if I attempt to escape, they will...&quot;deal&quot; with me. And perhaps Isabel and Joanne as well, once they start questioning my disappearance. 
What irony...to believe that the very place I had considered my intellectual monastery is now the darkest of cells. All of us, test subjects and experimenters alike, are like the test rats in the cages of our facility. We are trapped.&quot; 
 
The rest of the pages are torn. You stifle a sigh.

&quot;Don&apos;t let the apparent absence of memories convince you that they are completely gone. You must explore.&quot; The Voice halters. &quot;Someone taught me that. It only took me a while to realize.&quot; 
Sylvester sits musingly near the drawer compartment on the ground.

Entry #5

Subject 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked, just as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily activity. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

You see a tape recorder under the papers.

    <result xml:space="preserve">A voice speaks. It is masculine and sounds bone-weary. The voice sounds somewhat familiar. 
&quot;So they&apos;ve finally rebelled. At long last. Luckily for me, I expected it. I heard the subjects murmur under their breaths, fall silent when an experimenter walks by. But I heard them. They knew. They figured it out. 
They&apos;ve done a fine job. Made every one of my colleagues run faster than I&apos;ve ever seen them run. I hid in this room until the storm passed. When I ventured outside, the facility was empty. The test subjects escaped...well, most of them. There is still Subject 46, Edward Baker, and, of course...he must still be around.&quot; 
There is a hefty sigh. 
 &quot;It&apos;s been two days since the breakout. The military hasn&apos;t arrived. If they do, they&apos;ll just find me, and two failures of test subjects. Hah. Well, my dear, dear government, how do you like that?&quot; 
You hear the sound of a bottle swishing. The man recording must be drinking something. 
&quot;Regardless...I&apos;m glad. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should do now. I considered burning this place down. Maybe I should. Make it seem like this place never existed...wipe it out of people&apos;s memories...heh! After that, I&apos;ll go home...yes, I&apos;ll go home. And make myself disappear. They can&apos;t find me. Nor my family. 
And yet...I linger here. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown attached to my haven-turned-prison. A bittersweet attachment. No matter. I&apos;ve stayed here for long enough. I must depart before those uniform-donning dogs arrive. 
Ah...but of course... Yes. My sliver of hope throughout all these months. The resistor. I feel the urge to watch him again...to observe his steady march through the facility...He forgets every time he does it, but he does it every day...like an automaton. 
I think...I will stay. Watch him, for one last time, before I leave this place. But this time, he won&apos;t return to his cell. He&apos;ll be gone, like the others. I&apos;ll make sure of it. 
My name is Doctor John Parr, supervising researcher at Soma Memory Labs. Date...I&apos;ve lost track. Who cares. This will be my last experimental observation.&quot; 
 
 The recorder falls silent. 
 &quot;...Yes. That&apos;s it.&quot; The Voice sounds faintly approving. &quot;Well done. Now, look to your right. Do you see that keypad? Why don&apos;t you type in the key. You&apos;re almost done.&quot;

He cracks a small smile at you. An artificial smile. &quot;My name is Doctor John Parr,&quot; he says in the voice of a doctor greeting a patient. The words sound familiar. As if you had heard it months ago. &quot;Your experiment has been concluded. Thank you for your participation. We value your support and patience.

You step outside and feel the sand under your shoes. The wind blows gently. The sun&apos;s bright and you have to squint to adjust to the glare. 
Beside you, Sylvester meows and purrs against your leg. 
Slowly, you make your way down the field, Sylvester by your side, beginning a long, long walk.&quot; ***

 Subject 11519 has been exhibiting the same kind of behavior ever since his treatment. He has been traversing the entire facility, each and every room. Whenever he reaches the Experimental room, he marks the map with a tally mark and his initials.
 
 The subject had entered the facility as a young man who suffered from severe depression. He came after we advertised under the new motto that the military had told us to take on: &quot;New memory therapy for your mental health.&quot; His consent form reveals that his motive for joining our project was to &quot;Be happier.&quot; Memory loss can assist this, but we did not reveal to him the grave turnabout of our experiments, the fact that our research was meant to completely annihilate the capability to remember at all.
 
 But Subject 11519 persists in his travels. He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be.
 
 Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?

We knew it wouldn&apos;t take long for them to sniff out what we were doing. But we didn&apos;t think they would come so soon. The military wasted no time approaching the supervisor and compelling him (yes, I say compel) to make our facility&apos;s research an undercover study. 
We originally strove to find a way to enhance human memory. We failed and found a way to disintegrate it. Our trash became someone else&apos;s treasure. 
Those government dogs told us why we should continue. The memory-disintegration method, they claim, will be extraordinarily helpful for their work. POWs will forget all they have seen during their stay with the enemy when they are returned. Those who have seen too much of what lies behind the government veil will no longer be a threat. 
A good number of us have protested vigorously, but not for long, unsurprisingly. Some are thrilled by the change in objective, taking delight in the so-called &quot;partnership&quot; with the military. As for me, I have only the deepest of doubts about this operation. We are doing a service to our country, they said. I feel no pride in doing it. 
In the next month, we are changing the experimentation designs. To find test subjects, we are projecting ourselves to the public under a new slogan that we offer therapeutic treatment for those with mental conditions.&quot; 
 
 Entry # 2 
Date: February 6, 2016 
I am supervising the progress of one of the newest participants to arrive to our facility. His name is Sebastian Weaver, under subject number 11519. A typical severely-depressed young male who yearned to be happy. &quot;Do good, Parr,&quot; Kevin had said, patting me on the back. I nearly punched his face. 
When I spoke to him during his interview, I wished I had just told him the truth. Just blurt out what we were really doing. But, coward that I am, I didn&apos;t. I sometimes wonder why I stay in this damn place, but it is then that I see the faces of Isabel and Joanne. Surely, since I know the truth behind our research, I know a valuable secret of the military. Surely, if I attempt to escape, they will...&quot;deal&quot; with me. And perhaps Isabel and Joanne as well, once they start questioning my disappearance. 
What irony...to believe that the very place I had considered my intellectual monastery is now the darkest of cells. All of us, test subjects and experimenters alike, are like the test rats in the cages of our facility. We are trapped.&quot; 
 
The rest of the pages are torn.

&quot;Those were memories. Don&apos;t let the apparent absence of memories convince you that they are completely gone. You must explore.&quot; The Voice halters. &quot;Someone taught me that. It only took me a while to realize.&quot; 
Sylvester sits musingly near the drawer compartment on the ground.

 Subject 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
 I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked, just as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily activity. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

You see a tape recorder under the papers.

 The doctor opens the door, revealing a flat, sandy field. Outside. &quot;Forget I existed,&quot; he says quietly. &quot;Forget this face. Live your life and make lasting memories. I hope you become happy, Sebastian Weaver.&quot; Goodbye.

An intimidatingly large chair sits in the center of the room. The walls are adorned with pictures of words and drawings. 
Up ahead is an entryway...its door hangs off its hinges, almost completely shattered.

Nearby a heavy door leads west to the Lab.

One drawing is not of an object or person.

You realize the quiet breathing from before is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.

Subject 11519 has been exhibiting the same kind of behavior ever since his treatment. He has been traversing the entire facility, each and every room. Whenever he reaches the Experimental room, he marks the map with a tally mark and his initials.
 
The subject had entered the facility as a young man who suffered from severe depression. He came after we advertised under the new motto that the military had told us to take on: &quot;New memory therapy for your mental health.&quot; His consent form reveals that his motive for joining our project was to &quot;Be happier.&quot; Memory loss can assist this, but we did not reveal to him the grave turnabout of our experiments, the fact that our research was meant to completely annihilate the capability to remember at all.
 
But Subject 11519 persists in his travels. He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be.
 
Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?

We knew it wouldn&apos;t take long for them to sniff out what we were doing. But we didn&apos;t think they would come so soon. The military wasted no time approaching the supervisor and compelling him (yes, I say compel) to make our facility&apos;s research an undercover study. 
We originally strove to find a way to enhance human memory. We failed and found a way to disintegrate it. Our trash became someone else&apos;s treasure. 
Those government dogs told us why we should continue. The memory-disintegration method, they claim, will be extraordinarily helpful for their work. POWs will forget all they have seen during their stay with the enemy when they are returned. Those who have seen too much of what lies behind the government veil will no longer be a threat. 
A good number of us have protested vigorously, but not for long, unsurprisingly. Some are thrilled by the change in objective, taking delight in the so-called &quot;partnership&quot; with the military. As for me, I have only the deepest of doubts about this operation. We are doing a service to our country, they said. I feel no pride in doing it. 
In the next month, we are changing the experimentation designs. To find test subjects, we are projecting ourselves to the public under a new slogan that we offer therapeutic treatment for those with mental conditions.&quot; 
 
 Entry # 2 
Date: February 6, 2016 
I am supervising the progress of one of the newest participants to arrive to our facility. His name is Sebastian Weaver, under subject number 11519. A typical severely-depressed young male who yearned to be happy. &quot;Do good, Parr,&quot; Kevin had said, patting me on the back. I nearly punched his face. 
When I spoke to him during his interview, I wished I had just told him the truth. Just blurt out what we were really doing. But, coward that I am, I didn&apos;t. I sometimes wonder why I stay in this damn place, but it is then that I see the faces of Isabel and Joanne. Surely, since I know the truth behind our research, I know a valuable secret of the military. Surely, if I attempt to escape, they will...&quot;deal&quot; with me. And perhaps Isabel and Joanne as well, once they start questioning my disappearance. 
What irony...to believe that the very place I had considered my intellectual monastery is now the darkest of cells. All of us, test subjects and experimenters alike, are like the test rats in the cages of our facility. We are trapped.&quot; 
 
The rest of the pages are torn. You stifle a sigh.

&quot;Don&apos;t let the apparent absence of memories convince you that they are completely gone. You must explore.&quot; The Voice halters. &quot;Someone taught me that. It only took me a while to realize.&quot; 
Sylvester sits musingly near the drawer compartment on the ground.

Entry #5 
Date: October 6, 2016 
Subject 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked, just as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily activity. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

You see a tape recorder under the papers.

    <result xml:space="preserve">A voice speaks. It is masculine and sounds bone-weary. The voice sounds somewhat familiar. 
&quot;So they&apos;ve finally rebelled. At long last. Luckily for me, I expected it. I heard the subjects murmur under their breaths, fall silent when an experimenter walks by. But I heard them. They knew. They figured it out. 
They&apos;ve done a fine job. Made every one of my colleagues run faster than I&apos;ve ever seen them run. I hid in this room until the storm passed. When I ventured outside, the facility was empty. The test subjects escaped...well, most of them. There is still Subject 46, Edward Baker, and, of course...he must still be around.&quot; 
There is a hefty sigh. 
 &quot;It&apos;s been two days since the breakout. The military hasn&apos;t arrived. If they do, they&apos;ll just find me, and two failures of test subjects. Hah. Well, my dear, dear government, how do you like that?&quot; 
You hear the sound of a bottle swishing. The man recording must be drinking something. 
&quot;Regardless...I&apos;m glad. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should do now. I considered burning this place down. Maybe I should. Make it seem like this place never existed...wipe it out of people&apos;s memories...heh! After that, I&apos;ll go home...yes, I&apos;ll go home. And make myself disappear. They can&apos;t find me. Nor my family. 
And yet...I linger here. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown attached to my haven-turned-prison. A bittersweet attachment. No matter. I&apos;ve stayed here for long enough. I must depart before those uniform-donning dogs arrive. 
Ah...but of course... Yes. My sliver of hope throughout all these months. The resistor. I feel the urge to watch him again...to observe his steady march through the facility...He forgets every time he does it, but he does it every day...like an automaton. 
I think...I will stay. Watch him, for one last time, before I leave this place. But this time, he won&apos;t return to his cell. He&apos;ll be gone, like the others. I&apos;ll make sure of it. 
My name is Doctor John Parr, supervising researcher at Soma Memory Labs. Date...I&apos;ve lost track. Who cares. This will be my last experimental observation.&quot; 
 
 The recorder falls silent. 
 &quot;...Yes. That&apos;s it.&quot; The Voice sounds faintly approving. &quot;Well done. Now, look to your right. Do you see that keypad? Why don&apos;t you type in the key. You&apos;re almost done.&quot;

SOMA MEMORY LABS 
143-21 East Drive, SC, CA 
 Date: June 10, 2013 
SUBJECT NAME: 14 (John Akins) 
Age: 43 
Length of Stay: 10 months
 
Subject 14 arrived at the facility as a healthy middle-aged male with average memory skills. He performed well in the maze tasks and made few errors in recollection games. 
After being subjected to the treatment, Subject 14 exhibited gradual memory deterioration, as expected, but at a slower rate than the animals. He made errors in the mazes that he had been trained to do for months. 
By month 4, his short-term memory worsened to a time capacity of roughly 13 seconds. He struggled in recognizing the faces of his experimenters. 
By month 7, he failed to recognize a photo of himself, as well as his family members. 
By month 9, he fiercely demanded to be let out of the facility. We tacitly refused. There is a reason why the experiment went awry, and he is a valuable subject in our attempts to fix the issue. We&apos;ve been working for years on this project; it&apos;s preposterous that the outcome completely counters our goals. For the moment, we will ask him to continue his participation in the memory tasks. Perhaps we may have to expand the types of tasks our subjects perform to get to the heart of the issue. I heard of a suggestion for a human-sized maze. Interesting proposition.&quot;

Giant white walls. It&apos;s almost like a human-sized maze. Some blood disturbs the white.

Large holes are on the walls.

Graffiti lines the walls. It looks as if different people had written haphazardly on them.

&quot;It&apos;s funny,&quot; the Voice muses. &quot;They had to do this damn maze all the time and always complained that they wanted to just get out...it took them a while to figure out that they could just break down the walls. They always had the chance to escape.&quot;

Research Room
A large room half-lit with flickering fluorescent lights. There are photos of men and women on the walls. A map of the human brain is also hung up.

A drawer compartment sits on the floor.

A diary sits on top of a cracked table. &quot;Give it a read.&quot; The Voice sounded pained.

There is a photo within reach, dangling precariously from a clip on the wire.

Out of the corner of your eye, you see a white mouse nibbling at something near the wall.

Experimental Room
An intimidatingly large chair sits in the center of the room. The walls are adorned with pictures of random words and drawings. 
 
Northward is an entryway...its door hangs off its hinges, almost completely shattered.

A heavy door leads  to the Lab.

One drawing is not of an object or person and appears to be marked with something.

You realize the quiet breathing from before is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.

Research Room
A large room half-lit with flickering fluorescent lights. There are photos of men and women on the walls. A map of the human brain is also hung up.

A drawer compartment sits on the floor.

A diary sits on top of a cracked table. &quot;Give it a read.&quot; The Voice sounded pained.

We knew it wouldn&apos;t take long for them to sniff out what we were doing. But we didn&apos;t think they would come so soon. The military wasted no time approaching the supervisor and compelling him (yes, I say compel) to make our facility&apos;s research an undercover study. 
We originally strove to find a way to enhance human memory. We failed and found a way to disintegrate it. Our trash became someone else&apos;s treasure. 
Those government dogs told us why we should continue. The memory-disintegration method, they claim, will be extraordinarily helpful for their work. POWs will forget all they have seen during their stay with the enemy when they are returned. Those who have seen too much of what lies behind the government veil will no longer be a threat. 
A good number of us have protested vigorously, but not for long, unsurprisingly. Some are thrilled by the change in objective, taking delight in the so-called &quot;partnership&quot; with the military. As for me, I have only the deepest of doubts about this operation. We are doing a service to our country, they said. I feel no pride in doing it. 
In the next month, we are changing the experimentation designs. To find test subjects, we are projecting ourselves to the public under a new slogan that we offer therapeutic treatment for those with mental conditions.&quot; 
 
 Entry # 2 
Date: February 6, 2016 
I am supervising the progress of one of the newest participants to arrive to our facility. His name is Sebastian Weaver, under subject number 11519. A typical severely-depressed young male who yearned to be happy. &quot;Do good, Parr,&quot; Kevin had said, patting me on the back. I nearly punched his face. 
When I spoke to him during his interview, I wished I had just told him the truth. Just blurt out what we were really doing. But, coward that I am, I didn&apos;t. I sometimes wonder why I stay in this damn place, but it is then that I see the faces of Isabel and Joanne. Surely, since I know the truth behind our research, I know a valuable secret of the military. Surely, if I attempt to escape, they will...&quot;deal&quot; with me. And perhaps Isabel and Joanne as well, once they start questioning my disappearance. 
What irony...to believe that the very place I had considered my intellectual monastery is now the darkest of cells. All of us, test subjects and experimenters alike, are like the test rats in the cages of our facility. We are trapped.&quot; 
 
The rest of the pages are torn.

&quot;Those were memories. Don&apos;t let the apparent absence of memories convince you that they are completely gone. You must explore.&quot; The Voice halters. &quot;Someone taught me that. It only took me a while to realize.&quot; 
Sylvester sits musingly near the drawer compartment on the ground.

Entry #5 
Date: October 6, 2016 
Subject 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked, just as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily activity. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

You see a tape recorder under the papers.

    <result xml:space="preserve">A voice speaks. It is masculine and sounds bone-weary. The voice sounds somewhat familiar. 
&quot;So they&apos;ve finally rebelled. At long last. Luckily for me, I expected it. I heard the subjects murmur under their breaths, fall silent when an experimenter walks by. But I heard them. They knew. They figured it out. 
They&apos;ve done a fine job. Made every one of my colleagues run faster than I&apos;ve ever seen them run. I hid in this room until the storm passed. When I ventured outside, the facility was empty. The test subjects escaped...well, most of them. There is still Subject 46, Edward Baker, and, of course...he must still be around.&quot; 
There is a hefty sigh. 
 &quot;It&apos;s been two days since the breakout. The military hasn&apos;t arrived. If they do, they&apos;ll just find me, and two failures of test subjects. Hah. Well, my dear, dear government, how do you like that?&quot; 
You hear the sound of a bottle swishing. The man recording must be drinking something. 
&quot;Regardless...I&apos;m glad. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should do now. I considered burning this place down. Maybe I should. Make it seem like this place never existed...wipe it out of people&apos;s memories...heh! After that, I&apos;ll go home...yes, I&apos;ll go home. And make myself disappear. They can&apos;t find me. Nor my family. 
And yet...I linger here. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown attached to my haven-turned-prison. A bittersweet attachment. No matter. I&apos;ve stayed here for long enough. I must depart before those uniform-donning dogs arrive. 
Ah...but of course... Yes. My sliver of hope throughout all these months. The resistor. I feel the urge to watch him again...to observe his steady march through the facility...He forgets every time he does it, but he does it every day...like an automaton. 
I think...I will stay. Watch him, for one last time, before I leave this place. But this time, he won&apos;t return to his cell. He&apos;ll be gone, like the others. I&apos;ll make sure of it. 
My name is Doctor John Parr, supervising researcher at Soma Memory Labs. Date...I&apos;ve lost track. Who cares. This will be my last experimental observation.&quot; 
 
 The recorder falls silent. 
 &quot;...Yes. That&apos;s it.&quot; The Voice sounds faintly approving. &quot;Well done. Now, look to your right. Do you see that keypad? Why don&apos;t you type in the key. You&apos;re almost done.&quot;

SOMA MEMORY LABS 
143-21 East Drive, SC, CA 
 Date: June 10, 2013 
SUBJECT NAME: 14 (John Akins) 
Age: 43 
Length of Stay: 10 months
 
Subject 14 arrived at the facility as a healthy middle-aged male with average memory skills. He performed well in the maze tasks and made few errors in recollection games. 
After being subjected to the treatment, Subject 14 exhibited gradual memory deterioration, as expected, but at a slower rate than the animals. He made errors in the mazes that he had been trained to do for months. 
By month 4, his short-term memory worsened to a time capacity of roughly 13 seconds. He struggled in recognizing the faces of his experimenters. 
By month 7, he failed to recognize a photo of himself, as well as his family members. 
By month 9, he fiercely demanded to be let out of the facility. We tacitly refused. There is a reason why the experiment went awry, and he is a valuable subject in our attempts to fix the issue. We&apos;ve been working for years on this project; it&apos;s preposterous that the outcome completely counters our goals. For the moment, we will ask him to continue his participation in the memory tasks. Perhaps we may have to expand the types of tasks our subjects perform to get to the heart of the issue. I heard of a suggestion for a human-sized maze. Interesting proposition.&quot;

    <result xml:space="preserve">It contains a bunch of important looking papers. One in particular stands out: 
 
Subject 11519 has been exhibiting the same kind of behavior ever since his treatment. He has been traversing the entire facility, each and every room. Whenever he reaches the Experimental room, he marks the map with a tally mark and his initials. 
The subject had entered the facility as a young man who suffered from severe depression. He came after we advertised under the new motto that the military had told us to take on: &quot;New memory therapy for your mental health.&quot; His consent form reveals that his motive for joining our project was to &quot;Be happier.&quot; Memory loss can assist this, but we did not reveal to him the grave turnabout of our experiments, the fact that our research was meant to completely annihilate the capability to remember at all.
 
But Subject 11519 persists in his travels. He has indeed exhibited memory deterioration, mostly in the form of amnesiac episodes, but he still walks through the facility, makes his marks, and returns to his cell. He does not want to forget. His supervising experimenter, Dr. John Parr, is interested in his antics and insists that we do not interfere. It&apos;s worth noting that he has been acting oddly recently; he does not seem enthusiastic and prefers to keep to himself. If 11519&quot;s behavior begins to pester our research, then we will act accordingly. But for the moment, we will let him be.
 
Note: Humorously enough, he has a travel partner. The damn cat that always manages to escape before we can do anything to him. Perhaps they are both attempting to rebel against us?

&quot;You&apos;ve been doing well,&quot; the Voice suddenly spoke. It sounds quieter than usual. &quot;There is a room up ahead at the end of the maze. Once you&apos;re done exploring this area, can you squeeze through the holes and get to the end of the maze?&quot;

We knew it wouldn&apos;t take long for them to sniff out what we were doing. But we didn&apos;t think they would come so soon. The military wasted no time approaching the supervisor and compelling him (yes, I say compel) to make our facility&apos;s research an undercover study. 
We originally strove to find a way to enhance human memory. We failed and found a way to disintegrate it. Our trash became someone else&apos;s treasure. 
Those government dogs told us why we should continue. The memory-disintegration method, they claim, will be extraordinarily helpful for their work. POWs will forget all they have seen during their stay with the enemy when they are returned. Those who have seen too much of what lies behind the government veil will no longer be a threat. 
A good number of us have protested vigorously, but not for long, unsurprisingly. Some are thrilled by the change in objective, taking delight in the so-called &quot;partnership&quot; with the military. As for me, I have only the deepest of doubts about this operation. We are doing a service to our country, they said. I feel no pride in doing it. 
In the next month, we are changing the experimentation designs. To find test subjects, we are projecting ourselves to the public under a new slogan that we offer therapeutic treatment for those with mental conditions.&quot; 
 
 Entry # 2 
Date: February 6, 2016 
I am supervising the progress of one of the newest participants to arrive to our facility. His name is Sebastian Weaver, under subject number 11519. A typical severely-depressed young male who yearned to be happy. &quot;Do good, Parr,&quot; Kevin had said, patting me on the back. I nearly punched his face. 
When I spoke to him during his interview, I wished I had just told him the truth. Just blurt out what we were really doing. But, coward that I am, I didn&apos;t. I sometimes wonder why I stay in this damn place, but it is then that I see the faces of Isabel and Joanne. Surely, since I know the truth behind our research, I know a valuable secret of the military. Surely, if I attempt to escape, they will...&quot;deal&quot; with me. And perhaps Isabel and Joanne as well, once they start questioning my disappearance. 
What irony...to believe that the very place I had considered my intellectual monastery is now the darkest of cells. All of us, test subjects and experimenters alike, are like the test rats in the cages of our facility. We are trapped.&quot; 
 
The rest of the pages are torn.

&quot;Those were memories. Don&apos;t let the apparent absence of memories convince you that they are completely gone. You must explore.&quot; The Voice halters. &quot;Someone taught me that. It only took me a while to realize.&quot; 
Sylvester sits musingly near the drawer compartment on the ground.

Entry #5 
Date: October 6, 2016 
Subject 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked, just as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily activity. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

You see a tape recorder under the papers.

    <result xml:space="preserve">A voice speaks. It is masculine and sounds bone-weary. The voice sounds somewhat familiar. 
&quot;So they&apos;ve finally rebelled. At long last. Luckily for me, I expected it. I heard the subjects murmur under their breaths, fall silent when an experimenter walks by. But I heard them. They knew. They figured it out 
They&apos;ve done a fine job. Made every one of my colleagues run faster than I&apos;ve ever seen them run. I hid in this room until the storm passed. When I ventured outside, the facility was empty. The test subjects escaped...well, most of them. There is still Subject 46, Edward Baker, and, of course...he must still be around.&quot; 
There is a hefty sigh. 
 &quot;It&apos;s been two days since the breakout. The military hasn&apos;t arrived. If they do, they&apos;ll just find me, and two failures of test subjects. Hah. Well, my dear, dear government, how do you like that?&quot; 
You hear the sound of a bottle swishing. The man recording must be drinking something. 
&quot;Regardless...I&apos;m glad. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should do now. I considered burning this place down. Maybe I should. Make it seem like this place never existed...wipe it out of people&apos;s memories...heh! After that, I&apos;ll go home...yes, I&apos;ll go home. And make myself disappear. They can&apos;t find me. Nor my family. 
And yet...I linger here. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown attached to my haven-turned-prison. A bittersweet attachment. No matter. I&apos;ve stayed here for long enough. I must depart before those uniform-donning dogs arrive. 
Ah...but of course... Yes. My sliver of hope throughout all these months. The resistor. I feel the urge to watch him again...to observe his steady march through the facility...He forgets every time he does it, but he does it every day...like an automaton. 
I think...I will stay. Watch him, for one last time, before I leave this place. But this time, he won&apos;t return to his cell. He&apos;ll be gone, like the others. I&apos;ll make sure of it. 
My name is Doctor John Parr, supervising researcher at Soma Memory Labs. Date...I&apos;ve lost track. Who cares. This will be my last experimental observation.&quot; 
 
 The recorder falls silent. 
 &quot;...Yes. That&apos;s it.&quot; The Voice sounds faintly approving. &quot;Well done. Do you see that keypad to your right? Why don&apos;t you type in the key. You&apos;re almost done.&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s funny,&quot; the Voice muses. &quot;They had to do this damn maze all the time and always complained that they wanted to just get out...it took them a while to figure out that they could just break down the walls. They always had the chance to escape.&quot;

Research Room
A large room half-lit with flickering fluorescent lights. There are photos of men and women on the walls. A map of the human brain is also hung up.

 Entry #5 
 Date: October 6, 2016 
 Subject 11519...no, Sebastian...has been walking around the facility every day for the past two months. I followed him and saw what he was doing. He was marking his travels. At that moment, I gained clarity. He was attempting to retain his memories. 
 I became excited. I told Sebastian to mark his initials as well, instead of just making tally marks. I even let the cat follow him nearly all the times he walked, just as another supplement to his memory retention, a constant in his daily activity. He is the first to exhibit such behavior. And it is subtle enough that no one else would suspect him, of both of us, doing anything.

You see a tape recorder under the papers.

    <command xml:space="preserve">listen to tape recorder</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">A voice speaks. It is masculine and sounds bone-weary. The voice sounds somewhat familiar. 
&quot;So they&apos;ve finally rebelled. At long last. Luckily for me, I expected it. I heard the subjects murmur under their breaths, fall silent when an experimenter walks by. But I heard them. They knew. They figured it out 
They&apos;ve done a fine job. Made every one of my colleagues run faster than I&apos;ve ever seen them run. I hid in this room until the storm passed. When I ventured outside, the facility was empty. The test subjects escaped...well, most of them. There is still Subject 46, Edward Baker, and, of course...he must still be around.&quot; 
There is a hefty sigh. 
 &quot;It&apos;s been two days since the breakout. The military hasn&apos;t arrived. If they do, they&apos;ll just find me, and two failures of test subjects. Hah. Well, my dear, dear government, how do you like that?&quot; 
You hear the sound of a bottle swishing. The man recording must be drinking something. 
&quot;Regardless...I&apos;m glad. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should do now. I considered burning this place down. Maybe I should. Make it seem like this place never existed...wipe it out of people&apos;s memories...heh! After that, I&apos;ll go home...yes, I&apos;ll go home. And make myself disappear. They can&apos;t find me. Nor my family. 
And yet...I linger here. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown attached to my haven-turned-prison. A bittersweet attachment. No matter. I&apos;ve stayed here for long enough. I must depart before those uniform-donning dogs arrive. 
Ah...but of course... Yes. My sliver of hope throughout all these months. The resistor. I feel the urge to watch him again...to observe his steady march through the facility...He forgets every time he does it, but he does it every day...like an automaton. 
I think...I will stay. Watch him, for one last time, before I leave this place. But this time, he won&apos;t return to his cell. He&apos;ll be gone, like the others. I&apos;ll make sure of it. 
My name is Doctor John Parr, supervising researcher at Soma Memory Labs. Date...I&apos;ve lost track. Who cares. This will be my last experimental observation.&quot; 
 
 The recorder falls silent. 
 &quot;...Yes. That&apos;s it.&quot; The Voice sounds faintly approving. &quot;Well done. Do you see that keypad to your right? Why don&apos;t you type in the key. You&apos;re almost done.&quot;

A brightly lit room that is white as snow. A large TV sits in the corner, along with a few chairs. Some coffee tables sit nearby. A small camera hangs nearly thirteen feet above you. The floor is spotless.

The camera beeps to life. It swivels and points down to you. You see the lens readjusting, focusing.

Suddenly, the room echoes with the sound of a tinny voice. It sounds somewhat muffled, hidden behind an artificial tone. &quot;Hello. You finally woke up, I see. Hope you had adequate sleep. Can you give me a greeting so I know that you can hear me?&quot;

Equipment Area
The room is entirely trashed. Papers are scattered all over the gray floor. Westward you can see another room, lit in an ominous red color.

You see some photos that resemble X-rays, but they appear to be burnt.

A deplorable desk is here.

A bedraggled white cat sits snugly on top of a messy desk. A collar is around its neck. It stares at you with beady yellow eyes. 
&quot;That&apos;s Sylvester.&quot; You jump, startled, as you hear the artificial Voice echo in the room you&apos;re in. &quot;He&apos;s quite a friendly cat. He enjoys a nice touch on the head.&quot;

Red Room
Dozens of photos of men and women alike, from young to old, hang on a wire in the air. This is a photo-developing room, it seems. To the north you can see an entrance to a brightly lit room.

There is a photo within reach, dangling precariously from a clip on the wire.

Out of the corner of your eye, you see a white mouse nibbling at something near the wall.

There is a small, hand-crafted, wooden maze on a table.

A black cabinet stands near the table.

A disgusting brown cockroach sits on top of the cabinet.

Sylvester saunters into the room after you, purring and wearing a rather satisfied look on his face. You can only guess why.

Experimental Room
An intimidatingly large chair sits in the center of the room. The walls are adorned with pictures of random words and drawings. 
 
Northward is an entryway...its door hangs off its hinges, almost completely shattered.

A heavy door leads  to the Lab.

One drawing in the room is not of an object or person and appears to be marked with something.

You realize the quiet breathing from before is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.

Hallway
A dimly-lit hallway. There is complete darkness to your left and right and you feel a chill at the unsettling emptiness. North is an open entryway.

A gated door leads  to the Dark Cell.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Chamber
A brightly lit room that is white as snow. A large TV sits in the corner, along with a few chairs. Some coffee tables sit nearby. A small camera hangs nearly thirteen feet above you. The floor is spotless.

The camera beeps to life. It swivels and points down to you. You see the lens readjusting, focusing.

Suddenly, the room echoes with the sound of a tinny voice. It sounds somewhat muffled, hidden behind an artificial tone. &quot;Hello. You finally woke up, I see. Hope you had adequate sleep. Can you give me a greeting so I know that you can hear me?&quot;

The room is entirely trashed. Papers are scattered all over the gray floor. Westward you can see another room, lit in an ominous red color.

You see some photos that resemble X-rays, but they appear to be burnt.

A deplorable desk is here.

A bedraggled white cat sits snugly on top of a messy desk. A collar is around its neck. It stares at you with beady yellow eyes. The Voice speaks: &quot;That&apos;s Sylvester. He&apos;s quite a friendly cat. He enjoys a nice touch on the head.&quot;

Curious, eh?&quot; You jump, startled, as you hear the artificial Voice in the very room you&apos;re in. &quot;Like I said, I&apos;ll be watching you. Explore as much as you like around here.&quot; There&apos;s a short pause. &quot;No one will stop you.&quot;

Red Room
Dozens of photos of men and women alike, from young to old, hang on a wire in the air. This is a photo-developing room, it seems. To the north you can see an entrance to a brightly lit room.

There is a photo within reach.

The room is huge and brightly lit. If you stay quiet, you can hear muffled breathing coming from somewhere...

A heavy door leads east.

A series of cages line the walls, all open.

There is a small, hand-crafted, wooden maze on a table.

A black cabinet stands near the table.

A cockroach sits placidly on the cabinet surface.

Sylvester meows and begins to sniff eagerly at the cages.
