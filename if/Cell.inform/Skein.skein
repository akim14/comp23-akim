Cell
An Interactive Fiction by Aromie Kim
Release 1 / Serial number 140311 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

You open your eyes and see nothing but darkness. You try to remember what happened, why you&apos;re here, but thinking alone makes your head throb.

Dark Cell
The air feels oddly heavy. The dark is unsettling.

A door with a cracked sign saying &quot;BATHROOM&quot; is at your left.

An open, gated door stands before you.

    <result xml:space="preserve">(first opening the bathroom door)
You open the bathroom and almost reel back from the rancid stench.

Bathroom
A dirty bathroom with a putrid smell. You&apos;d rather not stay here for long.

You can see a bathroom door, a toilet and a medicine cabinet (in which are a card and a key) here.

Dark Cell
The darkness of the room brings some comfort as you open your aching eyes. You struggle to remember what had happened, but your head aches just thinking. The air feels oddly heavy. You can&apos;t see much, but you can see a door to your left, and a gated cell door in front of you.

You can see a bathroom door here.

A dirty bathroom with a putrid smell. You&apos;d rather not stay here for long.

An intimidatingly large chair sits in the center of the room. The walls are adorned with pictures of words and drawings of random objects, from houses to animals.

The room is entirely trashed. Papers are scattered all over the floor. West is another room, lit in red.

You see some photos that resemble X-rays, but they appear to be burnt.

A deplorable desk is here.

A bedraggled white cat sits snugly on top of a messy desk. A collar is around its neck. It stares at you with beady yellow eyes. The Voice speaks: &quot;That&apos;s Sylvester. He&apos;s quite a friendly cat. He enjoys a nice touch on the head.&quot;

The room is huge and brightly lit.

To the left is a heavy, locked door that says &quot;DO NOT ENTER.&quot; You can hear something behind it: is that breathing?

A series of cages line the walls, all open.

There is a small, hand-crafted, wooden maze on a table.

A black cabinet stands near the table.

A cockroach sits placidly on the cabinet surface.

To the left is a heavy, locked door that says &quot;DO NOT ENTER.&quot; You can hear something behind it: is that breathing?

You realize the quiet breathing is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.

 Subject 14 arrived at the facility as a healthy middle-aged male with average memory skills. He performed well in the maze tasks and made few errors in recollection games. After being subjected to the treatment, Subject 14 exhibited gradual memory deterioration, as expected, but at a slower rate than the animals. He made errors in the mazes that he had been trained to do for months. By month 4, his short-term memory worsened to a time capacity of roughly 13 seconds. He struggled in recognizing the faces of his experimenters. By month 7, he failed to recognize a photo of himself, as well as his family members. By month 9, he fiercely demanded to be let out of the facility. We tacitly refused. There is a reason why the experiment went awry, and he is a valuable subject in our attempts to fix the issue. For the moment, we will ask him to continue his participation in the memory tasks.&quot;

Dozens of photos of men and women alike hang on a wire in the air. To the north you can see an entrance to a brightly lit room.

There is a photo within reach.

Sylvester scampers into the room and looks at you meaningfully. &quot;He seems to take a liking to you,&quot; the Voice remarks.

The room is huge and brightly lit.

To the left is a heavy, locked door that says &quot;DO NOT ENTER.&quot; You can hear something behind it: is that breathing?

A series of cages line the walls, all open.

There is a small, hand-crafted, wooden maze on a table.

A black cabinet stands near the table.

A cockroach sits placidly on the cabinet surface.

Sylvester hisses and begins to pace actively around the room

Experimental Room
An intimidatingly large chair sits in the center of the room. The walls are adorned with pictures of words and drawings of random objects, from houses to animals.

To the left is a heavy, locked door that says &quot;DO NOT ENTER.&quot; You can hear something behind it: is that breathing?

You realize the quiet breathing is from a man sitting in the chair. He does not look at you and wears a blank expression.
